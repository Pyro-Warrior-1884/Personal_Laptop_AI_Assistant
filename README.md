### Personal Laptop AI Assistant

Started this project as simple passion project for creating a personalised ai assistant (named BMO) for my laptop.<br>
Inspiration started off from seeing the ai helper jarvis from the marvel cinematic universe.<br>
The project is a far cry from completion but a work in progress nonetheless.<br>
